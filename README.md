# movie-rec
Our attempt at creating a system to recommend a similar movie given a user's preferences.

This project leverages [TMDb's](https://www.themoviedb.org) API to grab metadata about movies and TV shows (full details
on TMDb's API can be found [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)), as well as
[JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/) (partnered with TMDb) to determine the available providers for movies and TV
shows per country.
